# Markov

By looking at all the n-grams, we are able to use that and the markov chain theory to predict what will come after some given words. This will produce tone-like text that matches the data given. For example, we provided the Shakespeared poems and literatures, the output text will sound like Shakespeare's literature

## How to Use

In the `markov` directory, run the command

`python generator.py shakespeare.txt`
