# Information Extraction
Let the AI take in template sentences and it will be able to extract the information from the same template it knows. For instance, by giving the AI the sentencesï¼š

- "Facebook was founded in 2004"
- "Google was founded in 1998"

And by telling the AI that "Facebook, 2004" and "Google, 1998" are what we are looking for, the AI will be able to recognize the template that 
- "{company} was founded in {year}"
